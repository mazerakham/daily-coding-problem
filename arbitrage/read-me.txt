Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. 
Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some 
sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so 
that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.

Solution:

Implemented in arbitrage.c++, in the function existsArbitrage().  The problem
is equivalent to finding a cycle of negative net weight after applying the
negative logarithm to the exchange rates.  Examples are in the main()
function, of both an arbitrage and non-arbitrage exchange table.
